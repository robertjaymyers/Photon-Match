Saving dictionary text file as UTF-16 BE keeps the french special characters intact when bringing them into the program and adding them to pushbutton text (so far). Will have to try a wider variety of characters and see if it still holds.

(see: http://www.herongyang.com/Unicode/UTF-16-UTF-16BE-UTF-16LE-Encoding.html -- for what BE means)
